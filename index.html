              <h3>My goals</h3>
              <p>
                I am hoping to build the foundation for future success, with this class. I feel like this class will teach me the fundamentals of becoming a life long student of coding!
    						Some of my more concrete goals would be to learn the basics to carry me into the Javascript Immersion class, and learn how to make the best websites possible.

               <h3>I hate Git</h3>
               <p>
                 If I were to be honest, I didn't have the problems with Git that I thought I would. To be clear, I was leery and nervous at working with the terminal in general. Luckily I had the time to go through the Treehouse course on using the terminal and Git. Both of those courses prepared me work with the real deal once class started. I was also able to draw on my experience playing text adventure games, such as Zork. Zork is a text adventure game which only has a text interface. Git and the terminal was a trip back to my childhood!

               <p>
                 Git has ended up being as useful and nifty as I would have hoped! I can't wait to use it further.

               <h3>Week 3</h3>
               <p>
                 It's hard to believe that three weeks has already gone by. In those three weeks, I have realized how little I actually know. What a humbling experience it has been! Reflecting back on these past weeks also allows me to see how far I have come. I have now written one website from scratch and used a template to build another one! I am excited to see where the next three months and the next three years brings.

               <h3>What's up with lists?!</h3>
               <p>
                 Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
               </p>
               <ul>
  				      <li><a href="http://www.facebook.com">go here</a></li>
  				      <li><a href="http://www.instagram.com">go there</a></li>
  				      <li><a href="http://www.twitter.com">go someplace else</a></li>
				      </ul>
              <p>Or as a way to display sets of things.</p>
              <p>My favorite colors</p>
              <ul>
  				      <li><span class="redText">red</span></li>
  				      <li><span class="blueText">blue</span></li>
  				      <li><span class="greenText">green</span></li>
		          </ul>
              <p>You will use lists alot.</p>

                 I am enjoying using the command line more then I thought I would. On a very corny level, it makes me feel like an actual developer. I have an appreciation for being able to navigate around a computer with a text only interface.

                 Git is a valuable tool in the arsenal of any developer. It allows us to collaborate and publish projects in a controlled way. I have a lot to learn about Git still but I feel like I am making progress with it everyday.
